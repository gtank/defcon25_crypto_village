This is foremost an implementation of the curve Ed25519 that satisfies Go's
elliptic.Curve interface. It targets amd64 systems, and is eventually intended
to be a legible general-purpose library along the lines of curve25519-dalek.

It is also an implementation of GF(2^255-19) field operations in a 64-bit
representation, in both pure Go and plan9 assembly for amd64. This code is
currently package-internal.

The library is a WORK IN PROGRESS. Everything will change dramatically as
development continues. There are no guarantees of stability, functionality,
correctness, or safety. We aren't open yet, come back later!
